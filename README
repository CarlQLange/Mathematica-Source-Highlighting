The JavaScript can be opened with Google Chrome and is then installed as a local extension.
When you browse pages under http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ and have Mathematica code posted
on the page its style is replaced and you should see nice code highlighting.

The JavaScript was written by Tim Stone and I only added the rules for the lexical scanner and
colors which go along with the page colors of StackOverflow.
